# Appointment-Scheduler
Test Project built with ASP.NET Core WebAPI on the backend and Vue.js on the frontend.

The backend is built with SoC in mind and heavily implements Dependency Injection and the Repository Pattern. The Data-layer uses a text-file (freebusy.txt) which consists of rows with users and rows with times consisting of information regarding when these users are busy (in other words not bookable).

The frontend is built with Vue.js and Vuetify for UI-components.
